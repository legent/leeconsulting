      <p class="f3 f2-ns">I’m an exceptional product management leader with over ten years of experience building, launching, and growing world-class digital products and services at early stage start-ups and F500 companies.</p>
      <p><strong>Strategy + Vision</strong><br>I define product goals, customers, primary features, and use cases. I outline what product success looks like and the metrics to measure that success by. I immerse myself in the competitive landscape and develop a strategy to differentiate a product’s offering. I care deeply about distribution, business model, pricing, and incentives to develop a solution that flourishes in the market.</p>
      <p><strong>Communication + Leadership</strong><br>I effectively communicate the “why” behind the product roadmap, prioritization, and sequencing of a release strategy. Collaborating closely with leadership, engineering, design, sales, marketing, support, data science, legal, and other relevant functions of the organization, I always act as the voice of the customer and ensure that their expectations are exceeded through the product solutions my teams deliver.</p>
      <p><strong>Prioritization + Problem Solving</strong><br>I own the roadmap for the product and develop a framework for how we prioritize what we build. I look for opportunities to un-obstruct my teams (e.g. from externalities such as staffing or dependencies), as well as ways to un-encumber my teams to achieve their goals at peak velocity (e.g. by avoiding over-engineering or by leveraging existing solutions).</p>
      <p><strong>Execution</strong><br>I work closely with engineering to set and achieve our goals on time. I have extensive agile training and experience with several project management tools and services. I write clear, succinct, comprehensive PRDs and I do not shy away from technical complexities or edge cases. With my design and user experience background, I push my teams to deliver their best work to production.</p>
