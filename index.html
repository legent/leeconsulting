      <p class="f3 f2-ns">Build a product that your customers will love <em>and</em> pay for, with coaching from an internet entrepreneur and product veteran wielding over a decade of product leadership experience.</p>
      <p class="mt4 f3-ns f5"><strong>Product Strategy</strong><br>What is your vision for your product? Who does it benefit? How does it create value? I will help you identify, hone, and articulate what makes your product unique and valuable to your target customer while ensuring that we never lose sight of your business goals. By recalibrating your product strategy, we will better inform your product roadmap and maximise your product’s chance for success in the market.</p>
      <p class="mt4 f3-ns f5"><strong>Product Marketing</strong><br>Are you preparing for the release of a new product or revisiting the marketing plan for an already launched product? We’ll outline your product’s positioning, messaging, and overall go-to-market strategy. We’ll interview potential customers or members of your sales team to ensure that the value of your product is understood. Finally, we’ll evaluate the efficacy of your existing distribution channels or assess new opportunities to drive demand and usage.</p>
      <p class="mt4 f3-ns f5"><strong>Product Design</strong><br>Is your product vision translating into tangible outcomes for your target customer, or is your product getting in the way of their success? With the aid of design thinking and problem solving exercises, informed by several years as a real-world usability, interaction, user experience, and visual design practitioner, we will simplify your product so that it’s value is obvious and unmistakable.</p>
      <p class="mt4 f3-ns f5"><strong>Product Development</strong><br>Do your product teams have what they need from you to build a great product? We’ll review your development process (tools, methodologies, etc.) and the shared artifacts you use (roadmaps, PRDs, prototypes, etc.) to translate your product vision into actionable and achievable units of work. Additionally, I’ll guide you through the trade-offs of reducing scope in order to hit a deadline or to validate fundamental assumptions about your product.</p>
